# Comparative study of the olfactory system in Drosophila suzukii and melanogaster
These are the raw data from the study:

"Differential coding of fruit, leaf, and microbial odours in the brains of Drosophila suzukii and Drosophila melanogaster" Claire Dumenil, Gülsüm Yildirim, Albrecht Haase
bioRxiv 2024.08.30.610544; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.30.610544

## The Flydata.xlsx table contains the following data from the brain imaging experiment:
- Plane: one of three image planes (top, middle, bottom)
- Antlobe: left/right antennal lobe	
- Species: D. melanogaster/suzukii	
- fly_id: subject ID
- glo_type: glomerulus type, for nomenclature see https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2005.07.034
- glo_id: glomerulus ID
- samples 1-87: normalized fluorescence signal, trial averaged, 87 time points at 9.6 Hz sampling rate, odour pulse starts after 2s and ends after 5s 	
- Odour: odour type	
- Position_x/y: lateral position of the glomerulus center in the image plane

## The Behaviour tables and graphs.xlsx table contains the following data from the behavioural assay:
- Experimental conditions: time, date, experiment duration, temperature, humidity
- Species: D. melanogaster/suzukii	
- Age: days after eclosion
- Condition: experiment ID see paper
- Gage ID: which of the 8 cages was used
- Trap: which of the 4 cage traps is counted
- Bait 1: 1st odour in the experiment
- Bait 2: 2nd odour in the experiment
- position bait: trap position in cage
- N flies bait: counted fies in trap
- Ntot baits: number of flies in all traps
- Ntot cage: number of flies in the experimental cage
- proportion: N flies bait/Ntot baits
- ID: results ID
